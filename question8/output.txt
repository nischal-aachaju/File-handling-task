ONE EVENING, A YOUNG PROGRAMMER STAYED 
LATE IN THE COMPUTER LAB, FIXING A 
STUBBORN BUG. FRUSTRATED, 
HE ALMOST GAVE UP. SUDDENLY, 
THE PROGRAM RAN PERFECTLY. 
SMILING, HE REALIZED PATIENCE 
MATTERED MORE THAN TALENT. 
HE SHUT DOWN THE COMPUTER, 
WALKED OUTSIDE, AND FELT 
PROUD SMALL VICTORIES CAN 
CHANGE EVERYTHING.
